This project is made to improve my understanding in site building.
Here I want to make restfull app with some simple logic and many features in models and db
In this project a logic is less important than data which I stored. First of all I need to understand how to 
effectively store and use data.

I don't really know a lot of stuff about django framework and app building
so it is a project to improve that. 
=======================================================
Firstly I wanna make backend and frontend separately and than some simple logic to check that
this is my source for now [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-uvtDKeFgE&list=PLA0M1Bcd0w8xZA3Kl1fYmOH_MfLpiYMRs&ab_channel=selfedu]


I've learnt some stuff about dbs (only theory)
    1.acid [done]
    2.cap theorem [done] 
    3.normalizations(3 forms) [done]  
    4.transactions[done]


Buut, I don't have any practice skills. I can't event do simple SQL insert query.
I separate practice into 3 parts:
    1.SQL language
    2.db designs
    3.design eye(to analize how existed db was made)
