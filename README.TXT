This project is made to improve my understanding in site building.
Here I want to make restfull app with some simple logic and many features in models and db
In this project a logic is less important than data which I stored. 

First of all REST design and work with db

=======================================================

Firstly I'll make a simple app (not restfull) and then will rebuild it as restfull app.
